Build an intelligent AI-powered web platform that accepts both pasted code snippets and uploaded text/code files in multiple programming languages including C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript, and generates detailed, easy-to-understand code explanations. The platform should support multi-level comprehension modes, allowing users to choose their preferred explanation style—simplified for a 10-year-old or technical for a 20-year-old—making it accessible to all levels of learners. It must visually represent the code’s logic and flow through interactive flowcharts, execution diagrams, and animated 3D models, especially for complex structures like arrays, matrices, trees, and graphs. Iterative loops, conditional branches, and control flows should be visualized dynamically to show how the code executes step-by-step. A dedicated “Why?” mode should allow users to click on any line or block of code and receive reasoning-based explanations for its function. Users must be able to request corrections for buggy or incomplete code, receive fixed versions, and see clearly what mistakes were made and why. The platform should automatically detect and highlight errors in code and provide descriptive visual explanations. A natural voice-based explanation system should read and explain the code aloud in human-friendly language. The system must include a complexity analyzer that calculates and explains both time and space complexities of the provided code. Users should be able to run their code in a secure sandbox environment with live step-by-step execution, showing real-time updates of variable values and logic flow. Version comparison tools must visually track how the code has changed over time, supporting learning from iterative improvements. Smart refactoring suggestions should be presented with side-by-side comparisons between original and improved versions, along with detailed explanations for each optimization—especially those improving performance or reducing memory usage. The platform must include a professional code editor with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and smart indentation for a seamless development experience. Users should be able to export explanations, visual diagrams, and summaries as downloadable files and share them through direct chat links or embeddable widgets. A built-in quiz generator should create practice questions from the current explanation context to reinforce understanding. The system must auto-generate test cases from the submitted code, allowing users to verify its behavior and explore test-driven development techniques. Important code concepts such as loops, recursion, arrays, and conditions should be automatically tagged and categorized. Literal code explanations should be accompanied by real-world analogies to improve conceptual clarity. The platform should also integrate with version control services, enabling users to import code directly from repositories and analyze ongoing projects. Future capabilities should include collaborative real-time explanation sessions, plugin support for in-editor integration, user dashboards for history and saved visualizations, and AI-generated documentation for full project repositories. The interface must be intuitive, responsive, customizable (e.g., dark/light modes), and visually engaging—creating a complete, interactive learning and debugging environment tailored for modern coders.
